# Puzzle Description

A **battery bank** is modelled as a string of digits.

Examples are:

- 987654321111111
- 811111111111119
- 234234234234278
- 818181911112111

For a given number n of batteries in a battery bank, the **joltage** is the maximum integer value that results from taking n digits of the bank and parse this as a long value.

Examples:

- In the bank 987654321111111, the joltage for 12 batteries can be found by taking the first 12 digits to produce 987654321111.
- In the bank 811111111111119, the joltage for 12 batteries can be found by taking the digits 811111111119.
- In the bank 234234234234278, the joltage for 12 batteries can be found by taking the digits 434234234278.
- In the bank 818181911112111, the joltage for 12 batteries can be found by taking the digits 888911112111.
